\label{hyperas}
Hyperas \cite{hyperas}, is a Keras wrapper for Hyperopt \cite{bergstra2015hyperopt}. Initially, it was chosen as the preferred tool 
to do hyperparameter optimization, because it is based on Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) \cite{bergstra2011algorithms}, an automated and efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm.
But it did not offer any way to evaluate Siamese networks. 
So, a simple solution was developed which enables the use of Hyperas for Siamese networks. After consulting with the author of Hyperas, 
this solution has been contributed as an example in the Hyperas official repository. Can be found here:
