\section{Densenet}

In Densenet each layer connects to every layer in a feed-forward fashion. 
With the basic idea to enhance the feature propagation, each layer of Densenet blocks takes the feature-maps of the previous stages as input.

Where the branches of the Siamese network are Densenet.

\section{Hyperparameters}
Hyper-parameters are those parameters whose values are set before the training, unlike other parameters whose values are learned during the training. 
For example learning rate, batch size. \cite{wikihyper}
