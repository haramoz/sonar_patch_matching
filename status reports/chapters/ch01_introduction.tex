\chapter{Introduction}

Patch matching is one of the fundamental tasks in todayâ€™s myriad computer vision and image processing applications. 
Patch matching can be used as low-level tasks like image stitching [5], structure from motion [6] or high-level task as object instance recognition [2],
object classification [3], multi-view reconstruction [4], image-retrieval etc.\\
Underwater environment is very difficult for optical cameras, as light is attenuated and absorbed by the particles in the water. 
And lot of real life monitoring and mappings tasks take place in cluttered and turbid underwater scenario. 
The limited visibility range of optical sensor is a big challenge. Hence sonar is more practical choice for underwater sensing as the sound can travel 
long distances with little attenuation. Though there are challenges with acoustic sensing as well, for example, it has low signal-to-noise ratio, lower 
resolution and unwanted reflections also cause problems.\\
Patch matching for acoustic images are getting increasingly useful in underwater scenarios for data association in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),
object tracking , sonar image mosaicing[15] etc. applications. Typical challenges in patch matching tasks are different viewing points, 
variations in illumination of the scene, occlusions and different sensor settings.

\subsection{Similarity function}

The objective  of this project is to learn a general similarity function for sonar image patches, which is able to predict that two input sonar 
image patches contain different views of a same object or not. But instead of using hand designed features (such as SIFT [16]) 
we will explore different deep learning architectures to encode such a function.
